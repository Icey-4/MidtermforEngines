The Singleton reloads the scene when needed. I used it because I couldn't remeber how I did it with comand in an ealier project and it was pretty simple.
The Observer updates the UI. This is useful so I don't have to check the varible evry frame
I was unable to complete the 3rd one in time. I was going to use a command to change input keys
